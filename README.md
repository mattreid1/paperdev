`paperdev` is an unofficial CLI tool that automatically starts and stops PaperSpace VMs. Only be billed for the exact amount of time you need.

Simply run `paperdev` to start your VM and drop you directly into SSH. When you `exit` your VM, `paperdev` will automatically stop your VM, preventing you from being billed for unused compute time. (You will still be billed for storage space, etc.)

## Background

A VM with 8 vCPUs and 16 GiB RAM costs US$95 per month - expensive for adhoc work. You can also run the VM for US$0.13 per hour but then you have to manually start and stop the VM in a web interface and you still get billed if you forget to turn it off.

If you run the VM for 30 hours a week, every week, for a month, at the end of the month you would be billed only US$16.77, saving you $78.23 (or more than 80%) for the above configuration. `paperdev` allows you to run VMs for only the hours you need with a single command.

This tools allows you to quickly spin up and spin down high powered machines (even with GPUs) for a fraction of the monthly cost.

## Install

This package is distributed via NPM. To install it, you can run `npm i -g paperdev`

## Usage

Before using `paperdev`, you must first enter your [API Key](https://docs.paperspace.com/core/api-reference/#how-to-generate-an-api-key) to enable the `paperdev` CLI tool to communicate with PaperSpace.

```
paperdev auth <API Key>
# Example: paperdev auth 4da89ce88462cbf1c6cd8b49fc2476
```

You must also create the VM in the [PaperSpace Core console](https://console.paperspace.com/). Make sure you set the **Public IP** option to **Dynamic** (preferred for cost optimization) or **Static** (for the IP address to not change). This is so you can connect to the VM over SSH. Once the VM is created, you must set the VM ID in `paperdev`.

```
paperdev set <VM ID>
# Example: paperdev set pkpzwrwzn
```

Once configured, simply run `paperdev` to start your VM and drop you directly into SSH. When you `exit` your VM, `paperdev` will automatically stop your VM, preventing you from being billed for the unused compute time.

Run `paperdev <command> --help` for help using any command.

```
